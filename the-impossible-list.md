title: The Impossible List
---

The below is an everchanging, incremental list of (quantifiable) things that I want to accomplish in life mostly revolving around my hobbies. I might sprinkle in some professional goals too when I have a better grasp of what I want to do professionally. 

This list is inspired by [Thomas Frank's list](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/), although I think he himself was inspired by someone else. Domino.
